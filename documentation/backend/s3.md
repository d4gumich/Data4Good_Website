## Overview

THe S3 bucket (Simple Storage Service) contains all the static assets for the webpage. The bucket contains all the files shown in this repo as well as a folder for the csv's to power the chart (for now).

### Steps for Updating

To update the webpage you will first need access to the AWS console and be created as a user. In addition, you will need to have a github account so you can clone this repo locally

1) Clone the repo and pull down all current changes. 
2) Log into the AWS console and nagivate to the s3 bucket. There are three buckets total, but the one you need to worry about is `www.data4good.center`.
3) Navigate to the files changed and where they are located in the s3 bucket - delete the old ones and replace with the new. *Note that the s3 bucket is set up the exact same as this repo. This is important as any file or folder addition will need to reflect the same nesting in the s3 bucket.
