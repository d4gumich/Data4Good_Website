## Overview

THe S3 bucket (Simple Storage Service) contains all the static assets for the webpage. The bucket contains all the files shown in this repo as well as a folder for the csv's to power the chart (for now).

### Steps for Updating

To update the webpage you will first need access to the AWS console and be created as a user. In addition, you will need to have a github account so you can clone this repo locally.

1) Clone the repo and pull down all current changes. 
2) Log into the AWS console and nagivate to the s3 bucket. There are three buckets total, but the one you need to worry about is `www.data4good.center`.
3) Navigate to the files changed and where they are located in the s3 bucket - delete the old ones and replace with the new. **Note that the s3 bucket is set up the exact same as this repo. This is important as any file or folder addition will need to reflect the same nesting in the s3 bucket**.
 
 ### Aliasing the webpage

 Since the webpage is hosted under the S3 bucket, it originally comes with an `aws` url. This makes getting to the webpage a tedious process for the end user. Becase we have a domain registered and want the webpage to be called `data4good.center`, we can set up aliasing on the S3 bucket. In order to do this, naviate to the S3 bucket -> Properties. Here you will see a bunch of different options. Feel free to explore the offerings to get familiar with some of the different preferences you can select for an S3 bucket. By selecting the `Static Hosting Webpage` square, you should see something like the image below.

The `index.html` always goes into the `index document` section since this is the page that powers the site. We also set up a `404.html` which is populated into the `error` section just incase the webpage does go down for any reason.
